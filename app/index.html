        Since the DFINITY network requires Participants to hold DFN in order to function, donations to the
        Foundation will be recorded in a special smart contract hosted on Ethereum
        (“FDC”).  The hope of the Foundation is that the FDC will define the initial allocations of DFN made to Participants.

        Therefore when the Foundation judges that special client software required to create the
        network is sufficiently mature,  the Foundation will
        recommend that the FDC is used as part of an initial state (“Genesis State”) of the DFINITY Network.

        Due to the long confirmation time required for Bitcoin network, your DFN

        donation transaction's first confirmation time is prior to donation end time, you should feel confident that
        the donation will be accounted accordingly.

        keys it needs. Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL that you take a copy of your seed <i>right now</i> and store it safely
        or YOU WILL LOSE ALL ACCESS TO YOUR DFN.</p>
    <div class="important-notes">
        <h3>Security Notes</h3>
        <p>We recommend that you create physical, printed copies of your seed. For example, print out the seed onto
            paper and put it into a fireproof safe. If you keep electronic copies of your seed, make sure they are
            secure and nobody else can access them. For example, store an electronic seed inside a Mac OS X encrypted
            file.

            <p> DFINITY Stiftung records the value donated in Swiss Francs (CHF) and uses this to calculate

            <p>When a total of 1M CHF in value has been received, DFINITY Stiftung will stop accepting further ETH/BTC

                the limit was reached.</p>

            <li class="c5 c0"><span class="c1">DFINITY will promote the development of software technology (&ldquo;The Client&rdquo;) that enables the creation of a public decentralized cloud computing platform the public can use to run server applications (&ldquo;DFINITY Network&rdquo;). Operation of the DFINITY Network involves transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units called dfinities (DFN). DFN is a participatory token that allows the holder to deploy and run software code, vote on network governance issues, support operation of the network through &ldquo;mining&rdquo;, and connect private DFINITY networks (&ldquo;Private Networks&rdquo;) to the DFINITY Network.</span></li>
            <li class="c5 c0"><span class="c1">When DFINITY judges that The Client has been sufficiently developed to allow the DFINITY Network to be launched, DFINITY will issue a public announcement recommending what initial state (&ldquo;Genesis State&rdquo;) it should have. The Genesis State will include allocations of DFN that are essential for the DFINITY Network to operate. The recommended allocations of DFN will reflect early contributions made towards the development of the network, and Donations made to support DFINITY. However, since the DFINITY Network will be operated by an independent community of participants around the world using The Client, the community has discretion to adopt or not to adopt the recommendation. Therefore, DFINITY cannot guarantee to any party that they will have an initial allocation of DFN, because this depends upon the discretion of the community. </span><span class="c2">The Donor understands and accepts that DFINITY cannot guarantee that Donors shall have any allocation of DFN when the DFINITY Network is created</span><span class="c1">.</span></li>

            <li class="c5 c0"><span class="c1">The Donor also understands and accepts that - as the allocation of DFN is smart contract based - the functions, terms and conditions applicable thereon are set forth in the FDC. To the extent the terms contained herein or in any other document or communication contradict to the ones set forth in the FDC, the terms of the FDC prevail.

            <li class="c5 c0"><span class="c1">The Donor understands and accepts the risks in connection with the Donation to DFINITY, and/or with the allocation, use and ownership of DFN, as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not concluding, the Donor understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:</span></li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_8-0">
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk of software weaknesses</span><span class="c1">: The Donor understands and accepts that the decentralized cloud concept, The Client, the Donation Software, the FDC and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories (including but not limited to Threshold Relay, Threshold Relay blockchains, Validation Towers, Validation Trees, USCIDs, Blockchain Nervous Systems, cryptography and game theoretic assumptions related to Proof of Stake networks involving security deposits) are still in an early development stage and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of DFN will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of DFN.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Regulatory risk</span><span class="c1">: The Donor understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the FDC and &nbsp;decentralized cloud concept and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the decentralized cloud concept and/or the DFINITY Network, including its termination and the loss of DFN for the Donor.</span></li>
            <li class="c0 c4"><span class="c2">Risk of abandonment / lack of success</span><span class="c1">: The Donor understands and accepts that the allocation of the DFN and the development of the DFINITY Network may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from industry and/or the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The Donor therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the DFINITY Network is partially or fully developed and launched, the Donor will receive any functionality through the DFN held by him.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk associated with other applications</span><span class="c1">: The Donor understands and accepts that the DFINITY Network may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which DFN will have no intrinsic value.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk of loss of private key</span><span class="c1">: DFN may only be accessed using a private key that corresponds to the address at which it is stored. Donor understands and accepts that if his private key, or the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; used to create his address and corresponding private key got lost or stolen, the obtained DFN associated with the Donor&rsquo;s address will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk of theft:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Donor understands and accepts that the decentralized cloud concept, the Donation Software, The Client, the virtual platform created by the DFINITY Network, the Ethereum network, the FDC smart contract hosted on Ethereum, and other technology components or platforms may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that that could result in theft or loss of DFN, or the theft or loss of Donations, impacting the ability to develop and launch the DFINITY Network.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk of blockchain mining attacks:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Donor understands and accepts that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the DFINITY Network may be susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the decentralized cloud system created by the DFINITY Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of DFN transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.</span></li>
            <li class="c4 c0"><span class="c2">Risk of governance attacks and failure: </span><span class="c1">The Donor understands and accepts that the DFINITY Network uses an in-built decentralized governance system called the Blockchain Nervous System, which involves &ldquo;neurons&rdquo; that can be created by supplying security deposits to the system in the form of DFN. These neurons vote on proposals submitted to the Blockchain Nervous System. The neurons can be controlled directly by their owners and can also operate automatically by following other neurons. Because the Blockchain Nervous System is integrated into the workings of the DFINITY Network, it can perform arbitrary privileged actions including freezing smart contract software, redistributing DFN, running software to modify smart contracts and/or their associated persistent data, changing the rules concerning the issuance of new DFN to miners as rewards, changing the quantity of DFN that must be deposited to create a mining identity or neuron, or to connect a Private Network, changing constitutional guidelines that might be provided to neuron owners to inform their collective decision making, and many other actions. For these reasons, it is possible that the Blockchain Nervous System adopts proposals that have an adverse effect on the useful functioning of the DFINITY Network and/or the value of DFN. If the Blockchain Nervous System is attacked, or becomes controlled either directly or indirectly by some party who makes unwise decisions, or the community generally makes unwise decisions, the value of DFN held by a Donor might be greatly reduced or even permanently lost. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li>
